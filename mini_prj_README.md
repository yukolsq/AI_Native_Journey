AI What If Story Generator
This is an interactive web application designed as a mini-project to explore creative storytelling and visualization using Artificial Intelligence. It allows users to reimagine existing movies by defining "what if" scenarios, generating new narratives, and visualizing key scenes.

Features:
Interactive Input: Easily enter a movie title and your imaginative "what if" question through a user-friendly interface.

AI-Driven Narrative Generation: Powered by the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, the application crafts a unique, short story (150-300 words) based on your scenario. It also intelligently identifies 2-3 visually striking key scenes from this new narrative.

AI-Generated Scene Visuals: For each identified key scene, the Imagen 3.0 Generate 002 model creates a corresponding still image, acting as concept art or a storyboard frame for your alternate movie.

Responsive Design: The interface adapts seamlessly for optimal viewing and interaction on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Robust Error Handling: Provides clear feedback and graceful degradation (e.g., placeholder images) if AI models encounter issues or cannot generate content for a specific prompt.

How to Use:
Open the Application: Access the index.html file in a web browser.

Enter Movie Title: Type the title of a movie (e.g., "Star Wars: A New Hope") into the designated field.

Enter "What If" Scenario: Describe your alternate scenario (e.g., "What if Darth Vader joined the Rebel Alliance?") in the text area. Be as descriptive as possible for better AI results.

Generate: Click the "Generate Story & Scenes" button.

View Results: The AI-generated story and corresponding scene images will appear below. If an image cannot be generated, a placeholder will indicate this.

Technology Used:
Frontend:

HTML: Structure of the web page.

CSS (Tailwind CSS): Modern, utility-first styling for a responsive and appealing design.

JavaScript: Handles all user interactions, dynamic content updates, and direct API calls to the AI models.

AI Models (Accessed via Google Cloud APIs):

Gemini 2.0 Flash: For text generation (narrative and scene descriptions).

Imagen 3.0 Generate 002: For image generation from text descriptions.

Important Notes:
Internet Connection Required: This application relies on external AI services, so an active internet connection is essential.

AI Generation Time: Generating stories and especially images can take a few moments. A loading indicator will be displayed during this process.

Image Generation Limitations: AI image generation can sometimes be sensitive to prompt content. If an image fails to generate, the application will display a placeholder, and trying a slightly different "What If" scenario might yield better results.
